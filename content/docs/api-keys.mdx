# API Keys
 How to create and get started using our API keys

<Callout>
API Keys make it easier.
</Callout>

## Getting Started

Go to the [dashboard/api-keys](https://mega-mess.vercel.app/dashboard/api-keys) and create an API key there.

## Setting up an API Key

Once you have clicked the "Create API Key" button, you will be asked for a name and description (both are non-required fields) and the website that you want to use our service for. It is recommended to provide a name and description to have an idea of the purpose for which you are utilizing the API endpoint.

## Using the API Keys

After copying the API keys, you can use them in your app.

The API endpoint for making a request is: `https://mega-mess.vercel.app/api/files`

For Next.js/React, you can use the following code:

# Step on claiming the apikey

- First go to the [MegaMess website dashboard](https://mega-mess.vercel.app/dashboard)
- Choose a menu called API-Keys
- Click on `Creating API Keys`
- Add your website you want to use megamess service
- Then copy the api key by clicking the copy button on the api key carrd 
- Upsert an `.env` file with MEGAMESS_API_KEY='megamess_************'
- THen you can use the `.env` file depending on the runtime you are using. like if it were node , you can use `process.env.MEGAMESS_API_KEY` or you can refer the usage of the `env` from their docs on how to use the   `.env` variables.





```js

export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'

export async function GET(req: Request) {
    // moking something that comes as a body - 
    // name , description , fileUrl
    const name = 'TEST NAMEE'
    const description = 'Test Descriptions'
    const fileUrl = 'https://files.edgestore.dev/syq4tyuw5ogm0mk3/publicFiles/_public/e36f81e8-e69f-4c62-91e4-a5f92563fc15.svg'
    const size = '1.4kb'
    const baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
    const res = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/api/files` , {
        method:"POST",
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'megamess-api-key': '1f083687c0e91906262c38c6bd77e722',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            name: name,
            description: description,
            fileUrl: fileUrl,
            size: size,

        })
        
    })
    const result = await res.json()

    return new Response(JSON.stringify(result))
} 
```

However to avoid the test names , test description , and the file url i highly recommend checking the our custome made comps for handling [file upload](https://github.com/Kinfe123/MegaMess/blob/main/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/_components/file-upload.tsx) with EdgeStore.



Then this give you the response which seems like below 


```json
{
    "id": "clu08y76o0003npsz4ig65gl8",
    "name": "TEST NAMEE",
    "description": "Test Descriptions",
    "fileUrl": "https://files.edgestore.dev/syq4tyuw5ogm0mk3/publicFiles/_public/e36f81e8-e69f-4c62-91e4-asa.svg",
    "size": "1.4kb",
    "userId": "cltoy4tyq00018px24ef2wvvg",
    "visiblity": "PRIVATE",
    "createdAt": "2024-03-20T20:19:08.640Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-03-20T20:19:08.640Z"
}
```


After that you now you got a file uploader component , file uploader api endpoints along with request headers including your API Key and now you can your files in our [`dashboard`](https://mega-mess.vercel.app/dashboard).
